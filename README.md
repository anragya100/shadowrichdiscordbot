**Required Permissions:** Manage Messages
- `message` (required): The announcement text

- Creates interactive buttons for ticket creation

## Ticket System Usage

1. Use `/setup-tickets` in your desired tickets channel
2. Users click "Contact Staff" to see category options
3. Selecting a category creates a private ticket channel
4. Only the user, staff, and moderators can see the ticket
5. Staff can close tickets using the close button

## Permissions Setup

The bot automatically detects staff roles by looking for roles containing:
- "staff"
- "mod" 
- "admin"

Make sure your staff members have these roles for proper ticket access.

## Rate Limiting & Best Practices

- The bot respects Discord's rate limits
- Commands include proper error handling
- Tickets are logged for administrative purposes
- Channels are automatically cleaned up when tickets are closed

## Troubleshooting

### Commands not appearing
- Make sure you've run `node src/deploy-commands.js`
- Check that CLIENT_ID is correct
- Global commands take up to 1 hour to appear (use GUILD_ID for instant deployment during development)

### Permission errors
- Ensure the bot has Administrator permissions
- Check that the bot role is above the roles it needs to manage
- Verify channel permissions for ticket creation

### Bot not responding
- Check that DISCORD_TOKEN is correct and valid
- Ensure the bot is online in your server
- Check console for error messages

1. Check the console logs for error messages
